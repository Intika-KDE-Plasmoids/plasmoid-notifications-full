# org.kde.plasma.notifications.full

Fork from KDE 5.8.7 Notification (org.kde.plasma.notifications) 

Features :
- Original kde notification features plus :

- Keep all notifications on the history whether persistent or not
- Support music players to avoid keeping music player notifications when you change song (only keep the last notification)

Supported music players :

Note : 

KDE Team already somehow solved the notifications problem since KDE v5.11 but on most distro KDE 5.11 is still not released under stable branch, it's why i made this one 

Install : 
- Just install from the KDE Market or load the plamoid file manually 
- Logoff, login to restart plasma 

Install Note : 

This applet will remplace the original notification applet for the current user... don't worry tho kde original files stay untouched 

Uninstall : 

Just remove the applet from the plasma applet menu and you will get back your original notification applet
